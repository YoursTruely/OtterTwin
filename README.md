# OtterTwin
Predictive Digital twin of USV Otter with Actuator Fault Diagnosis as a demonstrative feature.

--------------------

This project explores the use of digital twins for detecting and identifying a broken propeller fault in Otter's actuator. We use an adaptive kalman filter based actuator fault diagnosis algorithm for this purpose and detect an 18% fault in the port side broken propeller.
